To visualize a step-by-step solution to the Art Gallery problem (stationary guards, 360-degree vision).

- Visualized the solution to the art gallery problem by first applying Seidelâ€™s algorithm onto the art gallery
(polygon) to generate triangulated polygons and then applying vertex 3 coloring to obtain the location of the guards.
- Built the solution using C++ and used GNU plot to visualize the steps in the process.
